									<h2 class="major">C#/LUA: EAW Remastered</h2>
									<p>This passion project for the game Empire at War, was developed by James McGinty with the primary langauge being C mixing in LUA. C is primarily used to interact with existing game configs to implement new 3D assets, modify existing in-game units, and to overhaul the User Interface. LUA has been used for the addition of new quality of life scripts which are assigned to certain 3D assets. Using LUA I developed a script to allow for randomly spawning visual variations of 3D assets.<br /><br />This passion project was conducted from <strong>Spring 2020-Summer 2022</strong>.</p>
